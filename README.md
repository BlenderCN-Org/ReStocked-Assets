# ReStocked-Assets
My own Assets made for [ReStock](https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked). Please report any issues there. Models are made in Blender 2.79 and textures are made with Photoshop CC. All files are licensed CC-BY-SA 4.0. 

#### Naming Convention:
textures are named with the filename they will appear as in the final distributed version of the mod, with the exception of some specular maps which are copied into the alpha channel of the albedo textures. For example:
* `restock-sciencebox-1.psd`: Albedo map
* `restock-sciencebox-1-s.psd`: Specular map, copied into alpha channel of Albedo map except when the Specular (Mapped) shader is used
* `restock-sciencebox-1-n.psd`: Normal map, makes use of Smart Objects for the heightmap embedded within
* `restock-sciencebox-1-e.psd`: Emissive map
